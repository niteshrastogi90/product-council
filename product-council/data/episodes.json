    "description": "Aishwarya Naresh Reganti and Kiriti Badam have helped build and launch more than 50 enterprise AI products across companies like OpenAI, Google, Amazon, and Databricks. Based on these experiences, they’ve developed a small set of best practices for building and scaling successful AI products. The goal of this conversation is to save you and your team a lot of pain and suffering.\n\n*We discuss:*\n1. Two key ways AI products differ from traditional software, and why that fundamentally changes how they should be built\n2. Common patterns and anti-patterns in companies that build strong AI products versus those that struggle\n3. A framework they developed from real-world experience to iteratively build AI products that create a flywheel of improvement\n4. Why obsessing about customer trust and reliability is an underrated driver of successful AI products\n5. Why evals aren’t a cure-all, and the most common misconceptions people have about them\n6.

Dmitry shares his hard-won lessons, contrarian org design principles, and day-to-day practices that power Revolut’s relentless shipping velocity, culture of ownership, and unparalleled “wow” product experience.\n\n*What you’ll learn:*\n• Revolut’s unique organizational approach, where “product owners” manage cross-functional pods as “local CEOs,” with genuine end-to-end ownership and hiring/firing power\n• How a radical, ultra-flat structure enables more than 150 product owners to maintain founder-level quality and velocity across dozens of parallel launches\n• How Revolut maintains quality while shipping hundreds of features across over 50 countries\n• Why Revolut favors “raw intellect and hunger” over experience, and how internal transfers (including ex-engineers and ops managers) become the company’s most successful product leaders\n• How Revolut’s founders review every single UI shipped, and why this founder detail obsession scales rather than limits innovation\n• Their framework for launching new products—from ideation, validation, and first user cohort to rapid “algorithmization” and scaling across countries\n• The importance of treating products that are 99% done as closer to 0% done, vs. 100% done\n\n*Transcript:* https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/how-revolut-trains-world-class-product-managers\n\n*This entire episode is brought to you by:*\nStripe—Helping companies of all sizes grow revenue: https://stripe.com/\n\n*Where to find Dmitry Zlokazov:*\n• X: https://x.com/Dzlokazov\n• LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/zlokazov/\n\n*Where to find Lenny:*\n• Newsletter: https://www.lennysnewsletter.com\n• X: https://twitter.com/lennysan\n• LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/lennyrachitsky/\n\n*In this episode, we cover:*\n(00:00) Introduction to Dmitry and Revolut\n(03:41) Revolut’s unique approach to product management\n(06:58) The role and responsibilities of product owners\n(09:28) Types of product owners at Revolut\n(15:50) Building “wow” products\n(25:00) Hiring practices\n(31:33) Managing teams and projects\n(41:07) Revolut’s diverse product offerings\n(44:40) Scaling new products successfully\n(52:10) Attracting top talent\n(58:43) Failure corner\n(01:02:49) Lightning round and final thoughts\n\n*Referenced:*\n• Revolut: https://www.revolut.com/\n• Intercom: https://www.intercom.com/\n• Palantir: https://www.palantir.com/\n• Which companies produce the best product managers: https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/which-companies-produce-the-best\n• Which companies accelerate PM careers most: https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/which-companies-accelerate-your-pm\n• Deliver WOW to our customers: https://www.revolut.com/blog/post/deliver-wow/\n• Nik Storonsky on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/nstoronsky\n• Vlad Yatsenko on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/yatsenko/\n• How Palantir built the ultimate founder factory | Nabeel S.
